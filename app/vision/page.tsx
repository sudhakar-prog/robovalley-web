        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          The vision of Amaravati RoboValley is to build India&apos;s first
          integrated Robotics &amp; AI City – a place where learning, research,
          innovation, manufacturing, gaming, immersive experiences, startups and
          global talent grow together as one connected ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Robotics should become as natural a part of life as computers and
          smartphones – accessible to every student, every home, every
          institution and every innovator.

          Why Amaravati RoboValley?
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Education today often teaches robotics in fragments – a few kits, some
          coding exercises, and occasional sensor demonstrations. Most students
          never touch real robotics engineering, fabrication tools or industry
          platforms.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Amaravati RoboValley changes this by creating a fully practical,
          end-to-end robotics ecosystem where learners can move from basic
          curiosity to advanced capability in one integrated environment.
        </p>

        {/* Problem */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">
          What Problem Are We Solving?
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Young people in India often lack:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-4">
          <li>real robotics labs and tools</li>
          <li>affordable components and fabrication access</li>
          <li>expert guidance and mentorship</li>
          <li>exposure to industry and real-world problems</li>
          <li>practical engineering and innovation pathways</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          They graduate with certificates instead of deep, hands-on skills.
          Amaravati RoboValley is designed to give students real robotics
          exposure from the beginning, evolving them from learners to innovators
          and creators.

        {/* A Different Kind of City */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">A Different Kind of City</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          This is not just a robotics course or training center – it is a city
          designed around the future of robotics and humanity. It is envisioned
          as a unique place in India, capable of meeting future needs where
          robots become part of daily life, just as computers became common in
          homes and workplaces.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          In the coming decades, every home will have robots. Robots will assist
          humans in daily life, take up tasks in difficult or dangerous
          environments, and move into places where humans cannot survive. We are
          entering an era in which robots will explore deep oceans, survive
          extreme climates, operate in disaster zones, inspect hazardous
          industrial sites, repair space systems and help humanity work and live
          beyond Earth.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Robots will go where humans cannot – and help humanity thrive beyond
          physical limitations.

          India&apos;s Evolution of Tech Cities
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          India has already seen specialized hubs such as Cyber City, Pharma
          City, Genome Valley, MedTech City and Sri City. Amaravati RoboValley
          is the next evolution – a dedicated city for robotics, intelligent
          systems, immersive technologies, re-engineering, fabrication, gaming
          and AI-led innovation.

        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          At the core of RoboValley is a simple cycle:
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed font-semibold">
          Learn → Make → Innovate → Showcase → Build → Earn

          A New Educational Philosophy
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          We believe education must be hands-on, project-based and
          creation-driven. Robotics is not just a subject – it is a vehicle to
          teach engineering, creativity, systems thinking and innovation.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-4">
          <li>students work with real components and systems</li>
          <li>failure and iteration are treated as learning steps</li>
          <li>labs function like mini R&amp;D spaces</li>
          <li>projects connect to real-world applications</li>
        </ul>

        {/* Why Now */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Why Now?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Robots and intelligent systems are rapidly entering healthcare,
          agriculture, logistics, homes, industry, education and even space
          missions. Countries that master robotics will shape the next century
          of jobs, productivity and innovation.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          India cannot afford to be a late adopter in this domain. Amaravati
          RoboValley is a step towards making India a creator – not just a
          consumer – of robotics and intelligent systems.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Our Story</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Amaravati RoboValley began with a simple belief: robotics should be
          accessible to everyone – children, students, teachers, professionals
          and innovators. It grew out of observing how many talented young
          people had curiosity but lacked an ecosystem to convert that curiosity
          into capability.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          The idea is to build a place where a child&apos;s first exposure to a
          robot, a student&apos;s first project, a teacher&apos;s first lab and
          an innovator&apos;s first prototype can all coexist in the same
          ecosystem – and grow together.

          We believe in a future where robots live with us, automation supports
          us, innovation starts at childhood, and India becomes a global leader
          in robotics and AI. A future where learning is hands-on, creativity is
          valued and future skills emerge naturally.
