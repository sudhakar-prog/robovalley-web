        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Kreeda–Mandap is the Gaming and Competitive Robotics World of Amaravati RoboValley –
          designed to make technology a global sport. Here, robots and intelligent systems compete
          just like players in football, cricket or the Olympics, while students, institutes,
          companies and nations collaborate, compete and celebrate innovation.
