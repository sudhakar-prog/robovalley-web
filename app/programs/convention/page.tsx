        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Amaravati RoboValley will host a dedicated Robotics &amp; Intelligent
          Systems Convention – a focused gathering of students, educators,
          researchers, startups, robot manufacturers, system integrators and
          policymakers. The convention is designed as a working platform, not
          just a one-time event. Each edition showcases real robots and
          intelligent systems, connects talent with industry and institutions,
          and builds Amaravati&apos;s identity as a long-term robotics hub.
